## Ch1. Fibonacci Heap
- Efficient implementation of priority queue

Example of Problem:
1. Single-source Shortest Path Problem : for each Vertex v, compute shortest path from s to v. The classical solution is Dijkstra's Algorithm
2. Minimum Spanning Tree: classical solution is Prim's Algorithm

Both of them uses priority queue.
1. Binary Heap
2. d-ary Heap : reduce depth of tree ->  inserts and bottlenecking decrease-key operations excute in O(log_d|S|) time.
3. Fibonacci Heap : laziness. work when we do must. simplify the structure.

## Ch2. Network Flow
### 1. Shortest Path Problem
Shortest Path -> Minimum Cost Flow -> Multi-commodity Flow  

Transformation of an undirected edge into two directed edge for Dijkstra's algorithm.  

Negative length after transformation

Bellman-Ford Algorithm:  
1. Negative Edge Weights: It can handle graphs with negative edge weights.  
2. Negative Cycles: If the graph contains a negative cycle that is reachable from the source vertex, the Bellman-Ford algorithm can detect it. This is because if the shortest path is updated in the Vth iteration (where V is the number of vertices), it indicates the presence of a negative cycle. However, if there's a negative cycle that's not reachable from the source, Bellman-Ford will correctly compute shortest paths to all reachable vertices.  
3. Time Complexity: The algorithm is generally slower than Dijkstra's, with a worst-case time complexity of O(VÃ—E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.  

Dijkstra's Algorithm:  
1. Negative Edge Weights: Dijkstra's algorithm does not work correctly with negative edge weights. This is because Dijkstra's algorithm makes a greedy choice by selecting the next closest vertex based on the current shortest path estimations. If negative edges are introduced, a vertex that was previously processed might need its shortest path updated, but Dijkstra's algorithm doesn't reconsider such vertices.  
2. Negative Cycles: If the graph has negative cycles, Dijkstra's will definitely not work, as the concept of "shortest path" in the presence of negative cycles is not well-defined.  
3. Time Complexity: With a good priority queue (like a Fibonacci heap), its time complexity can be O(E+VlogV).

### 4. Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm
Augmenting Path still exists in residual network? -> push more flow!    


FORD-FULKERSON(G)  
1 start with a zero flow f  
2 while G has an augmenting path P  
3 do push $\epsilon(P)$ more units of flow through $P$, so that $\ |f| $ <- $\ |f| + \epsilon(P)$ 


does this algorithm ever halt?  
if more than one augmenting path in residual network, which one to choose?  
running time of the algorithm?  

case 1. capacity u is integer.
